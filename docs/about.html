    <h1>About Us</h1> <!--Page Title-->
    
    <h2>In 1952, Bob Smith realized that the citizens of Wormwood Hills were missing a place to spend time with their neighbors. 
      With the help of a few investors, Bob Smith raised the funds needed to buy a plot of land and begin building a community center. 
      After four years of construction, the community center opened its doors to the community on June 7th, 1956. 
      The community center gained 100 members in its first year of operations. 
      As of the beginning of this year, the community center now has over 3,000 members. 
      The Wormwood Hills Community Center started with just 5 employees and hosted only one workshop a month. 
      Now the community center has over 350 employees and 15 different workshops a week.</h2>
